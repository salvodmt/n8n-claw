## [1.2.2] — 2026-04-10

### New Skill: DZT Germany Tourism

First skill in the new **Tourism** category. Proxies the Deutsche Zentrale für Tourismus (DZT) MCP Server via One.Intelligence — no API key needed.

### Added
- **New skill: DZT Germany Tourism** — search German tourism data: POIs (museums, castles, landmarks), events (festivals, markets), hiking/cycling trails, and entity details. Uses MCP Streamable HTTP transport to proxy the DZT server at `destination.one`. Tools: `get_pois_by_criteria`, `get_events_by_criteria`, `get_trails_by_criteria`, `get_entity_details`.
- **New category: `tourism`** — template catalog gained a dedicated category for tourism and travel skills.

### Changed
- **CDN hash** updated to `03b490c` in Library Manager for the new template.

### Upgrade from v1.2.1
```bash
cd n8n-claw && git pull && ./setup.sh --force
```
Then install the new skill via chat:
- `install dzt-germany-tourism` — no credentials needed

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-10

### Token Optimization

Reduces main agent system prompt token usage by ~25% through fixing a persona data leak.

### Changed
- **Persona loading optimized** — full persona bodies no longer loaded into main system prompt; agent sees only the compact `expert_agents` meta-listing. Sub-Agent Runner loads full personas separately on delegation. Saves ~3,700 tokens per request.
- **setup.sh seed fix** — `expert_agents` seed changed from `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, preventing `setup.sh --force` from overwriting dynamically maintained expert agent metadata.

### Upgrade from v1.2.0
```bash
cd n8n-claw && git pull && ./setup.sh --force
```
No additional steps needed.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-09

### Hybrid Memory Search, Time Decay & Multi-Language

Memory retrieval upgraded from pure semantic search to three-branch hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The agent now finds people by name, survives embedding API outages, and naturally prefers recent context.

Hybrid search architecture inspired by [@geckse](https://github.com/geckse)'s [markdown-vdb](https://github.com/geckse/markdown-vdb) — a Rust-based vector DB with hybrid search (semantic + BM25 + RRF) designed for AI agents. We adapted the three-branch RRF fusion pattern for PostgreSQL using tsvector + pgvector.

### Added
- **Hybrid Search RPC** (`hybrid_search_memory`) — fuses three independent search branches via RRF (k=60, Cormack standard):
  - **Semantic** — pgvector cosine distance (unchanged from v1.1)
  - **Full-text** — tsvector with `ts_rank_cd` cover-density ranking (replaces primitive ILIKE fallback)
  - **Entity match** — direct ILIKE on `entity_name` for proper-noun boost
- **Time Decay** — exponential half-life scoring scaled by importance (`half_life = 90 + importance * 20` days, range 110–290d). Category exemption for `contact`/`preference`/`decision` (decay factor always 1.0). Enabled by default, opt-out via `use_time_decay=false`.
- **Multi-language full-text** — `unaccent` extension + `'simple'` tsvector config normalizes accents and umlauts across all languages (e.g. `München` matches `muenchen`, `résumé` matches `resume`)
- **GENERATED STORED column** `search_vector` on `memory_long` — auto-maintained by Postgres, no changes to INSERT/UPDATE workflows needed
- New migration: `supabase/migrations/005_hybrid_search.sql`

### Changed
- **Memory Search tool** now always calls `hybrid_search_memory` (single RPC, handles embedding-null gracefully via branch degradation). Old two-branch if/else removed.

### Breaking Changes
None. Old RPCs `search_memory` and `search_memory_keyword` remain in the database. Config-backup skill works unchanged (explicit column list, generated column auto-populates on restore).

### Upgrade from v1.1.1
```bash
cd n8n-claw && git pull && ./setup.sh --force
```
No skill updates needed. The migration runs automatically and backfills `search_vector` for all existing memories.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-08

### Bugfixes, Config Backup Skill Update, and Google Media Generation

Follow-up to v1.1.0 that closes two data-loss gaps discovered after release and ships the new Google Media Generation skill, a matching expert agent, and several template catalog improvements that landed between releases.

### Fixed
- **`config-backup` skill lost Knowledge System data** — the backup skill shipped in v1.1.0 did not know about the new enriched memory columns (`tags`, `entity_name`, `source`) or the `kg_entities` / `kg_relations` tables. Backups taken with the old skill silently dropped everything the v1.1.0 Knowledge System introduced. The skill is now bumped to `1.1.0` and saves:
  - `memory_long.tags`, `memory_long.entity_name`, `memory_long.source`
  - full `kg_entities` table (with UUID primary keys so relations can be restored)
  - full `kg_relations` table, ordered after `kg_entities` so foreign keys resolve on restore
  - backup format version bumped to `1.1` (old `1.0` backups remain restore-compatible)
- **`soul.proactive` silently wiped on `setup.sh --force`** — when a custom persona was set, the personalization block explicitly cleared the `PROACTIVE` variable before writing the `soul` table. The proactive/reactive choice from the setup menu was therefore discarded on every re-deploy, leaving the agent without any proactive-behavior instruction in its system prompt. Custom persona (tone/role) and proactive behavior (initiative style) are now treated as independent settings.
- **`google-media-gen` video generation timeout** — long-running Veo 3.1 video jobs exceeded the MCP tool-call timeout. Video generation is now split into a `generate_video` call that starts the job and a separate `wait_for_video` call that polls for completion.

### Added
- **New skill: Google Media Generation** — Nano Banana Pro for image generation/editing and Veo 3.1 for video generation and image-to-video animation. Tools: `generate_image`, `edit_image`, `generate_video`, `animate_image`, `wait_for_video`.
- **New expert agent: `google-media-prompter`** — specialized sub-agent for prompt engineering around Google's generative media models. Install via the Agent Library.
- **New category: `creativity`** — template catalog gained a dedicated category for generative media and creative tooling. `google-media-gen` moved out of `utilities`.
- **Tested column in skill catalog** — `n8n-claw-templates/README.md` now shows which skills have been smoke-tested on a live instance.
- **Keep-current for proactive setting** — `setup.sh --force` now reads the existing `soul.proactive` content from the DB and offers "Choose [keep current]" as the default, so manual DB edits to that row survive re-runs.
- **Custom → preset reset** — the custom persona prompt now accepts `reset` as an explicit way to drop the current custom persona and fall back to the preset selected via the Style menu. Previously there was no path from a custom persona back to a preset without direct DB editing.

### Upgrade from v1.1.0
```bash
cd n8n-claw && git pull && ./setup.sh --force
```
Then update the affected skills via chat:
- `update config-backup` — required to back up Knowledge System data
- `install google-media-gen` — optional, if you want Nano Banana / Veo 3.1
- `install agent google-media-prompter` — optional, expert prompter for the above

If your `soul.proactive` row was wiped by the old bug, re-running `setup.sh --force` and keeping the default choice will seed it with the proactive-behavior text.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-07

### Knowledge System & Bug Fixes

The agent now builds structured knowledge automatically — enriched memories with tags, entity tracking, auto-expiry, and a full knowledge graph with relationship mapping.

### Added
- **Enriched Memory** — memories now include tags (English lowercase keywords), entity names, and source tracking
- **Knowledge Graph** — new `kg_entities` and `kg_relations` tables for tracking people, companies, projects, events, and their relationships
- **Entity Manager** tool — search, save, update, relate, graph traversal, delete entities and relations
- **Auto-expiry** — memories expire based on category and importance (contact/preference/decision never expire, others after 90–180 days)
- **Memory Consolidation upgrade** — nightly job now extracts tags and entity names via LLM, sets auto-expiry, and cleans up expired entries
- **Proactive memory search** — agent searches memory before responding for better contextual answers
- **MCP connection guide** — docs for connecting Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and Cursor
- **New skills**: Config Backup, Lexware Office

### Fixed
- **`$` sign crash in conversations** (#26) — replaced Postgres nodes with PostgREST for Save Conversation and Log, eliminating pg-promise `$N` parameter interpretation
- **Hidden input hint** (#25) — setup now shows "(input is hidden for security)" when entering API keys. Thanks @LukasRegniet!
- **Umlaut handling** — `normalize()` transliterates ä→ae, ö→oe, ü→ue, ß→ss instead of stripping them
- **Recursive CTE** — graph traversal restructured for PostgreSQL 15 compatibility
- **Migration idempotency** — `004_knowledge.sql` drops both old and new function signatures

### Upgrade from v1.0.0
```bash
cd n8n-claw && git pull && ./setup.sh --force
```
`--force` is required for the new workflow tools (Entity Manager, updated Memory Save).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-05

### Multi-Provider, Zero Config

n8n-claw is now fully model-agnostic. Choose your LLM provider during setup and everything works out of the box — no manual node swapping, no credential juggling. This release also streamlines the installation to a 2-step process: clone & run, then chat.

### Added
- **LLM Provider Abstraction** — setup.sh automatically patches all LLM nodes in every workflow to match your chosen provider before importing
- **8 supported providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Mistral, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible
- **Mistral AI** as new provider option
- **Provider switching** via `./setup.sh --force` — re-imports all workflows with new provider nodes
- **Credential PATCH** — existing credentials are updated with current API keys on re-run (instead of reusing stale data)
- **Telegram webhook fix** — second deactivate/activate cycle at end of setup ensures reliable webhook registration on fresh install
- **Ollama model prompt** — interactive model selection during setup
- **File delivery pipeline** — agent can send files (PDFs, images, documents) back to users via `[send_file:]` markers

### Changed
- **Default models updated**: OpenAI → `gpt-5.4`, Gemini → `gemini-3-flash-preview`, Ollama → `glm-4.7-flash`
- **README simplified** — installation reduced to 2 steps (clone & run → chat), removed manual credential setup instructions
- **Memory Consolidation** reads LLM provider config from `tools_config` at runtime (works with any provider)

### Fixed
- Gemini credential type corrected to `googlePalmApi` (matches n8n node expectation)
- OpenRouter default model corrected to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Connection traversal in LLM node patch for nested workflow structures

### Upgrade from v0.17.0
```bash
cd n8n-claw && git pull && ./setup.sh --force
```
Choose your provider when prompted. All workflows will be re-imported with the correct LLM nodes.
